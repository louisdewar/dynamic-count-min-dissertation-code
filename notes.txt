Take some skew (heavy tailed one), so it will look more like our loose analysis.
For different values of alpha we need to see if the optimal number of hash functions does not depend on memory size (approximately).

Datastructure to keep the largest estimated elements (frequencies). heap data structure (maybe first 100).
